# Improving urban GPS accuracy for your app

At Android, we want to make it as easy as possible for developers to create the most helpful apps for their users.

`안드로이드에서, 우리는 개발자들이 앱 사용자들에게 가장 유용한 앱을 쉽게 만들기를 원합니다.`

That’s why we aim to provide the best location experience with our APIs like the Fused Location Provider API (FLP).

`이것이 FLP와 같은 우리의 API와 함께 최고의 위치 경험을 제공하는 것을 목표로하는 이유입니다.`

However, we’ve heard from many of you that the biggest location issue is inaccuracy in dense urban areas,

`그러나, 우리는 많은 유저로부터 밀집한 도시에서 여러번 위치가 정확하지 않다고 들었습니다.`

such as wrong-side-of-the-street and even wrong-city-block errors.

`잘못된 길가 그리고 심지어 잘못된 도시 구석 에러 같이 말입니다.`

This is particularly critical for the most used location apps, such as rideshare and navigation.

`이것은 특히 차량 공유와 네비게이션 같은 대부분의 위치 앱에 중요합니다.`

For instance, when users request a rideshare vehicle in a city, apps cannot easily locate them because of the GPS errors.

`예를 들어 유저가 도시에서 차량공유를 요청할 때, 앱은 GPS에러들 때문에 쉽게 위치를 찾을 수 없습니다.`

### The last great unsolved GPS problem

This wrong-side-of-the-street position error is caused by reflected GPS signals in cities,

`이 잘못된 길목 위치 에러는 도시에서 GPS 시그널들이 반사되며 발생하며`

and we embarked on an ambitious project to help solve this great problem in GPS.

`우리는 GPS 중요한 문제를 해결하기 위해 야심찬 프로젝트를 착수했습니다.`

Our solution uses 3D mapping aided corrections, and is only feasible to be done at scale by Google because it comprises 3D building models, raw GPS measurements, and machine learning.

`우리 솔루션은 3D 맵핑을 사용하며 이것은 3d 건물 모델과 GPS 측정 그리고 머신러닝으로 구성되어 있기 때문에 오직 구글에서 수행될 수 있습니다.`

The December Pixel Feature Drop adds 3D mapping aided GPS corrections to Pixel 5 and Pixel 4a (5G).

`12월 픽셀은 3d 매핑 gps보정을 픽셀기기에 추가했습니다.`

With a system API that provides feedback to the Qualcomm® Snapdragon™ 5G Mobile Platform that powers Pixel,

`픽셀을 움직이게하는 퀄텀 스냅드로곤 플랫폼에 사용하는 시스템 API를 사용하면`

the accuracy in cities (or “urban canyons”) improves spectacularly.

`도시(도시협곡)에서 정확도가 크게 향상됩니다.`

### Why hasn’t this been solved before?

The problem is that GPS constructively locates you in the wrong place when you are in a city.

``

This is because all GPS systems are based on line-of-sight operation from satellites.

``

But in big cities, most or all signals reach you through non line-of-sight reflections, because the direct signals are blocked by the buildings.

``

The GPS chip assumes that the signal is line-of-sight and therefore introduces error when it calculates the excess path length that the signals traveled.

``
The most common side effect is that your position appears on the wrong side of the street,

``

although your position can also appear on the wrong city block, especially in very large cities with many skyscrapers.

``

There have been attempts to address this problem for more than a decade. But no solution existed at scale,

``

until 3D mapping aided corrections were launched on Android.
