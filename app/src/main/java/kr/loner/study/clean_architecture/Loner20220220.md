# The Clean Architecture   
  
##Interface Adapters   
   
The software in this layer is a set of adapters that convert data from the format most convenient for the use cases and entities,
to the format most convenient for some external agency such as the Database or the Web.
``
   
It is this layer, for example, that will wholly contain the MVC architecture of a GUI.   
``   
   
The Presenters, Views, and Controllers all belong in here.   
``   
   
The models are likely just data structures that are passed from the controllers to the use cases, 
and then back from the use cases to the presenters and views.   
``   
   
Similarly, data is converted, in this layer, from the form most convenient for entities and use cases,
into the form most convenient for whatever persistence framework is being used.   
``   
   
i.e. The Database. No code inward of this circle should know anything at all about the database.   
``   
   
If the database is a SQL database, then all the SQL should be restricted to this layer, 
and in particular to the parts of this layer that have to do with the database.   
``   
   
Also in this layer is any other adapter necessary to convert data from some external form,
such as an external service, to the internal form used by the use cases and entities.   
``   
   
##Frameworks and Drivers.   
   
The outermost layer is generally composed of frameworks and tools such as the Database,
the Web Framework, etc.   
``   
   
Generally you don’t write much code in this layer other than glue code that communicates 
to the next circle inwards.   
``   

This layer is where all the details go.   
``   
   
The Web is a detail.   
``   
   
The database is a detail.  
``   
   
We keep these things on the outside where they can do little harm.   
``
